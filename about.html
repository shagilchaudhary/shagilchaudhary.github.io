It has 72 chapters across India, 511 student branches, and 100,000 members.[1]

            The Computer Society of India is a non-profit professional meet to exchange views and information learn and share ideas. The wide spectrum of members is committed to the advancement of theory and practice of Computer Engineering and Technology Systems, Science and Engineering, Information Processing and related Arts and Sciences.

Since 1974, when CSI became a member of IFIP, CSI has organized many IFIP sponsored events and was host to the 1978 Council meeting in Bombay and 1988 General Assembly in New Delhi. It represents India in technical committees and working groups of IFIP.</p><p> <br>''Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.''<br> -- Isaac Newton</p>
